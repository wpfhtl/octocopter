"However, SLAM does not address the sensor-placement portion of the map-building task. That is, given
the map built so far, where should the robot go next? This is the main question addressed in this paper.
Concretely, an algorithm is proposed to guide the robot through a series of “good” positions, where “good”
refers to the expected amount and quality of the information that will be revealed at each new location.
This is similar to the Next-Best View (NBV) problem studied in Computer Vision and Graphics. However,
in mobile robotics the problem is complicated by several issues, two of which are particularly crucial. One is
to achieve safe navigation despite an incomplete knowledge of the environment and sensor limitations (e.g.,
in range and incidence). The other is the need to ensure suﬃcient overlap between each new local model and
the current map, in order to allow registration of successive views under positioning uncertainties inherent
to mobile robots."

NBV is a sensor placement problem.
Extension to the ArtGallery-Problem.

In a static environment, a safe region remains safe under the union operation.

Man schlägt Punkte vor, die von möglichst vielen offenen Löchern des Grundrisses sichtbar sind. Von denen erstellt man 2d-sensorkeulen in den unbekanntne raum und nimmt den punkt, dessen kegel den größten umfang hat => potential information gain
